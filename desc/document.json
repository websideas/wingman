The difference that you see is due to the difference in the images. The Images used in the demo are all copyrighted and we do not have permissions to re-distrubute them. This is the reason why we have replaced the images in the export content that is shipped with the theme.</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>\n\tHow do I disable Comments in each page?</h3>\n<p>\tOn your dashboard, navigate to Theme Options &gt; Page panel, and disable the option &#39;Show comments on page&#39; in there.</p>\n"}],"use_sub": true,"logo": "http://wingman.kitethemes.com/assets/images/logo.png","favicon": "","customcss": "","easing": "swing","easingduration": "500","bgimage": "","bgrepeat": "repeat","bgattachment": "scroll","bgcolor": "FFFFFF","textcolor": "383838","linkcolor": "0000FF","hrcolor1": "EBEBEB","hrcolor2": "FFFFFF","btncolor": "FFFFFF","btncolor1": "0088CC","btncolor2": "0044CC","sidebarbgimage": "","sidebarbgrepeat": "repeat","sidebarbgcolor": "DDDDDD","sidebartextcolor": "222222","sidebarlinkcolor": "444444","sidebaractivecolor": "444444","sidebaractivetextcolor": "DDDDDD","sidebarhrcolor1": "AAAAAA","sidebarhrcolor2": "EEEEEE","cufon": "","documentationttype": "default","itemURL": "","sendJSON": "","sendZIP": "","sendPWD": ""}
